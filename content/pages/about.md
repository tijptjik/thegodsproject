**What is the god(s) project?**

the god(s) project explores how people in this city experience spirituality and create meaning for their lives.  In Hong Kong, with its dazzling distractions and churn of work-sleep-success, how do people pursue their religions?  We want to follow the followers and understand what happens when a community congregates in a shared sacred space, and how individuals define and connect with their God, gods and/or Truth (with a capital T).

**How do you exist?**

the god(s) project was selected as one of a few English-language programs to be broadcast on DAB 31, RTHK under CIBS, the Community Involvement Broadcasting Service.  CIBS is funded by the the government’s Community Involvement Broadcasting Fund, which provides resources for groups or individuals to produce their own radio programs.

the god(s) project makes its own editorial decisions.

**Why are you doing this?**

Hong Kong is one of the most religiously diverse cities in the world, which is awesome - but beyond walking past mosques, temples, churches and other places of worship on a daily basis, there is little opportunity to know what goes on behind those walls.  the god(s) project intends to expand our understanding of spirituality beyond the cursory tenets of each religion.  Faith can play a significant part in how people think about themselves and their actions, and we want to see how the texture of that faith changes throughout someone’s life.  That’s really what it comes down to - understanding how faith and its variety of forms encourage people to think differently about their actions and decisions.

**Who are you, even?**

I’m Steph.
