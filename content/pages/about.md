**What is the god(s) project?**

the god(s) project explores how people in this city experience spirituality and create meaning for their lives.  In Hong Kong, with its dazzling distractions and churn of work-sleep-success, how do people pursue their religions?  We want to follow the followers and understand what happens when a community congregates in a shared sacred space, and how individuals define and connect with their God, gods and/or Truth (with a capital T).

**How do you exist?**

the god(s) project was selected as one of a few English-language programs to be broadcast on DAB 31, RTHK under CIBS, the Community Involvement Broadcasting Service.  CIBS is funded by the government’s Community Involvement Broadcasting Fund, which provides resources for groups or individuals to produce their own radio programs.

the god(s) project makes its own editorial decisions.

**Why are you doing this?**

Hong Kong is one of the most religiously diverse cities in the world, which is awesome - but beyond walking past mosques, temples, churches and other places of worship on a daily basis, there is little opportunity to know what goes on in the lives of the people who seek behind those walls.  the god(s) project intends to explore faith beyond the cursory tenets of each religion.  Faith can play a significant part in how people think about themselves and their actions, and we want to see how its texture changes throughout someone’s life.  That’s really what it comes down to - understanding how faith and its variety of forms spur people to think about how they live and who they are.

**Who are you, even?**

I’m Steph.
